Hi, I'm Ken Koltermann. I'm currently the cofounder and CTO of Motion Medix LLC. My work focuses on leveraging recent advances in machine learning and wearable computing to improve how healthcare professionals can detect and treat motor function affecting diseases (primarily neurological diseases). I received my Ph.D. in computer science in 2024 from the College of William & Mary in Virginia under the supervision of [Dr. Gang Zhou](https://gzhou.pages.wm.edu/). I have 4+ years experience in the field of computing for healthcare, and have 4+ experience with designing human data collection studies including but not limited to: gait analysis, Parkinson's disease symptoms, adult and adolescent vital sign monitoring, and vital sign monitoring during sleep studies. I also am an experienced applied machine learning scientist with 6 years experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch to solve complex problems from healthcare to computer security. In my free time, I enjoy powerlifting, hiking, and reading!

<!---Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.--->
